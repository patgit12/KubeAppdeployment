######ignore a tracked file ########
This is what you want to do:

Add all the files, individually or in a folder, that you want to remove from the repo but keep locally to .gitignore.
Execute git rm --cached put/here/your/file.ext for each file or git rm --cached folder/\* if they are in a folder. (It is /\* because you need to escape the *)
Commit your changes.
Push to remote.
